However, there were two areas where we invested very little: the CLI output and user experience. With Jest 15 we are changing the framework radically to make it easier to use both for beginners and experienced users. We are excited that our investment in Jest is now paying off: we can move fast and improve the framework for Facebook and the open source community at light-speed.

If you are an existing Jest user you will very likely need to update your configuration for Jest 15. In most cases it will simplify your setup and Jest will provide useful error messages during the upgrade. All of the new defaults can be disabled to suit your needs, but we still consider the disabled features critical for Jest in certain situations and will continue to use and support them at Facebook long-term.
