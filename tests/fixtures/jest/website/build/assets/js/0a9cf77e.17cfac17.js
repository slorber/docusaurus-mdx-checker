of these methods and objects into the global environment. You don\'t have to require or import anything to use them. However, if you prefer explicit imports, you can do import {describe, expect, test} from \'@jest/globals\'.","sidebar":"api"},"architecture":{"id":"architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"If you are interested in learning more about how Jest works, understand its architecture, and how Jest is split up into individual reusable packages, check out this video:","sidebar":"docs"},"asynchronous":{"id":"asynchronous","title":"Testing Asynchronous Code","description":"It\'s common in JavaScript for code to run asynchronously. When you have code that runs asynchronously, Jest needs to know when the code it is testing has completed, before it can move on to another test. Jest has several ways to handle this.","sidebar":"docs"},"bypassing-module-mocks":{"id":"bypassing-module-mocks","title":"Bypassing module mocks","description":"Jest allows you to mock out whole modules in your tests, which can be useful for testing if your code is calling functions from that module correctly. However, sometimes you may want to use parts of a mocked module in your test file, in which case you want to access the original implementation, rather than a mocked version.","sidebar":"docs"},"cli":{"id":"cli","title":"Jest CLI Options","description":"The jest command line runner has a number of useful options. You can run jest --help to view all available options. Many of the options shown below can also be used together to run tests exactly the way you want. Every one of Jest\'s Configuration options can also be specified through the CLI.","sidebar":"api"},"code-transformation":{"id":"code-transformation","title":"Code Transformation","description":"Jest runs the code in your project as JavaScript, but if you use some syntax not supported by Node out of the box (such as JSX, TypeScript, Vue templates) then you\'ll need to transform that code into plain JavaScript, similar to what you would do when building for browsers.","sidebar":"api"},"configuration":{"id":"configuration","title":"Configuring Jest","description":"The Jest philosophy is to work great by default, but sometimes you just need more configuration power.","sidebar":"api"},"dynamodb":{"id":"dynamodb","title":"Using with DynamoDB","description":"With the Global Setup/Teardown and Async Test Environment APIs, Jest can work smoothly with DynamoDB.","sidebar":"docs"},"ecmascript-modules":{"id":"ecmascript-modules","title":"ECMAScript Modules","description":"Jest ships with experimental support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM).","sidebar":"docs"},"environment-variables":{"id":"environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","description":"Jest sets the following environment variables:","sidebar":"api"},"es6-class-mocks":{"id":"es6-class-mocks","title":"ES6 Class Mocks","description":"Jest can be used to mock ES6 classes that are imported into files you want to test.","sidebar":"docs"},"expect":{"id":"expect","title":"Expect","description":"When you\'re writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. expect gives you access to a number of \\"matchers\\" that let you validate different things.","sidebar":"api"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"Install Jest using your favorite package manager:","sidebar":"docs"},"jest-community":{"id":"jest-community","title":"Jest Community","description":"The community around Jest is working hard to make the testing experience even greater.","sidebar":"docs"},"jest-object":{"id":"jest-object","title":"The Jest Object","description":"The jest object is automatically in scope within every test file.

Here\'s a list of the available packages:","sidebar":"docs"},"manual-mocks":{"id":"manual-mocks","title":"Manual Mocks","description":"Manual mocks are used to stub out functionality with mock data. For example, instead of accessing a remote resource like a website or a database, you might want to create a manual mock that allows you to use fake data. This ensures your tests will be fast and not flaky.","sidebar":"docs"},"migration-guide":{"id":"migration-guide","title":"Migrating to Jest","description":"If you\'d like to try out Jest with an existing codebase, there are a number of ways to convert to Jest:","sidebar":"docs"},"mock-function-api":{"id":"mock-function-api","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions are also known as \\"spies\\", because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is called indirectly by some other code, rather than only testing the output. You can create a mock function with jest.fn(). If no implementation is given, the mock function will return undefined when invoked.","sidebar":"api"},"mock-functions":{"id":"mock-functions","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.","sidebar":"docs"},"mongodb":{"id":"mongodb","title":"Using with MongoDB","description":"With the Global Setup/Teardown and Async Test Environment APIs, Jest can work smoothly with MongoDB.","sidebar":"docs"},"more-resources":{"id":"more-resources","title":"More Resources","description":"By now you should have a good idea of how Jest can help you test your applications.

In this section, we\'d like to link to community posts and articles about integrating Jest into popular JS libraries.","sidebar":"docs"},"timer-mocks":{"id":"timer-mocks","title":"Timer Mocks","description":"The native timer functions (i.e., setTimeout(), setInterval(), clearTimeout(), clearInterval()) are less than ideal for a testing environment since they depend on real time to elapse. Jest can swap out timers with functions that allow you to control the passage of time.

Combined, these features allow you to develop interactive experiences custom for your workflow.","sidebar":"docs"},"webpack":{"id":"webpack","title":"Using with webpack","description":"Jest can be used in projects that use webpack to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools because it integrates directly with your application to allow managing stylesheets, assets like images and fonts, along with the expansive ecosystem of compile-to-JavaScript languages and tools.","sidebar":"docs"}}}')}}]);
