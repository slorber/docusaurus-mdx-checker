# docusaurus-mdx-checker

A CLI to report potential MDX v3 parsing errors found in your content, using the same setup as Docusaurus v3 uses.

Run this command on your site:

```bash
npx docusaurus-mdx-checker
```

The output should give you an estimate of how many of your documents are incompatible with MDX v3 (Docusaurus flavor).

---

This tool was created to help Docusaurus v2 users (using MDX v1) upgrade incrementally to Docusaurus v3 (using MDX v3), or estimate the amount of work needed.
